# Contributing to Sovereign Syntax

We welcome architects, developers, and designers to evolve the Sovereign Syntax workspace.

## 🏛️ Contribution Philosophy
1. **Aesthetic Integrity:** Maintain the high-contrast "Architectural Sketch" style.
2. **Logic First:** Ensure reasoning strategies are high-fidelity and semantically accurate.
3. **Privacy First:** Never implement features that leak vault data to external analytics.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-logic`).
3. Commit with semantic messages.
4. Open a Pull Request.

## ⚖️ Code of Conduct
Respect all architects. Focus on technical excellence and clear communication.
